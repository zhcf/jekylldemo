    #On a system that can reach https://hpc.lenovo.com/downloads/
    #Download the package for your specific OS version
    #ex: For RHEL , xcat-2.13.0.lenovo1_confluent-1.4.0_lenovo-confluent-0.3-el7.tar.bz2
    wget https://hpc.lenovo.com/downloads/18b/xcat-<xcat version>.lenovo1_confluent-<confluent client/server version>-<osver>.tar.bz2
    
    #On your local system 
    #Create folder for the local repository
    mkdir /mnt/local_repo
    
    #Extract the repository 
    tar -xjvf <name of package> -C /mnt/local_repo
    
    #Create lenovo-hpc.repo to point to the local repository
    cd /mnt/local_repo/lenovo-hpc-<osver>/
