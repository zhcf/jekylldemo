After adding the correct repository as indicated in the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/), you can install xCAT by running:

    yum install xCAT

It is strongly recommended to also install lenovo-onecli:

    yum install lenovo-onecli

The default assures ability to use a local SQLite database.  If you want to use PostgreSQL you will also need:

    yum install perl-DBD-Pg

If you wish to use MySQL instead, then:

    yum install perl-DBD-MySQL

To verify that you have installed xCAT

    service xcatd status

At this point, source the script below for xCAT command line functionality or logout and log back in. 

    source /etc/profile.d/xcat.sh
