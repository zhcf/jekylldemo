Note that for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, the HA module is required to be available for xCAT install to succeed.

After adding the correct repository as indicated in the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/), you can install xCAT by running:

    zypper install xCAT

It is strongly recommended to also install lenovo-onecli:

    zypper install lenovo-onecli

The default assures ability to use a local SQLite database.  If you want to use PostgreSQL you will also need:

    zypper install perl-DBD-Pg

If you wish to use MySQL instead, then:

    zypper install perl-DBD-MySQL

To verify that you have installed xCAT

    service xcatd status

At this point, source the script below for xCAT command line functionality or logout and log back in. 

    source /etc/profile.d/xcat.sh

For some notes on configuring certain Lenovo equipment in xCAT, see [xCAT configuration notes]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/xcatconfignotes.html "xCAT config notes")
